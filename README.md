# protoc-gen-python-http

A simplistic code generator to generate [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/eolymp/) for E-Olymp API.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/eolymp/python-proto-http/cmd/protoc-gen-python-http
```

## Usage

Just like with any other code generator you need to run `protoc` with `python-http_out` flag. This code generator requires data structures generated by `python` code generator, so it should be enabled too.

```
protoc --python_out=build --python-http_out=build your.proto
```
